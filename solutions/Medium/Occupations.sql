/* explination:

1. ROW_NUMBER() Function:
   ```sql
   ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Occupation ORDER BY Name) AS RowNum
   ```
   This part of the query uses the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function. It assigns a unique row number to each row within its occupation group, ordered by the person's name. The `PARTITION BY Occupation` ensures that the numbering restarts for each occupation.

2. Derived Table (NumberedOccupations):
   ```sql
   SELECT
       Name,
       Occupation,
       RowNum
   FROM
       Occupations
   ```
   This subquery selects the `Name`, `Occupation`, and `RowNum` from the `Occupations` table, using the `ROW_NUMBER()` function to generate the row numbers.

3. Pivoting with Conditional Aggregation:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Doctor' THEN Name END) AS Doctor,
       MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Professor' THEN Name END) AS Professor,
       MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Singer' THEN Name END) AS Singer,
       MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Actor' THEN Name END) AS Actor
   FROM NumberedOccupations
   GROUP BY RowNum
   ```
   This part of the query uses conditional aggregation to pivot the data. The `CASE WHEN` statements are used to conditionally select the `Name` for each occupation. The `MAX` function is then used to aggregate these values for each `RowNum`, effectively transposing the data from rows to columns.

4. Final Result:
   The result is a table where each row represents a unique `RowNum` (corresponding to a unique combination of occupations), and the columns represent the names of individuals in each occupation.

In summary, the solution utilizes the `ROW_NUMBER()` function to assign row numbers to individuals within their occupation groups and then uses conditional aggregation to pivot the data, resulting in the desired output.
